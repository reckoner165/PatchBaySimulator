# PatchBaySimulator
Patch Bay Simulator python library to simulate studio patch bay.

A patch bay in a recording studio functions as a consolidated point of access to all or most of the equipment in the studio. 
A brief but solid introduction to its usage and functions can be found here: http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec99/articles/patchbay.htm

The documentation for the library is in progress just like the code itself. Your contribution would be greatly appreciated!
